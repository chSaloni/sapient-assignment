## Technical Stack 

1. **Angular 11** Framework
2. **HTML/CSS** for design (**Media Query** for Responsiveness)
3. **Server Side rendering** implementation
4. Deployement on **Heroku** `https://xt-space-launch.herokuapp.com/products`


## Pre Requisites to run the application locally
1. Clone https://github.com/chSaloni/sapient-assignment.git
2. Checkout branch `master`
3. Run `npm install` for all dependencies
4. To run the project `npm run dev:ssr`

*Angular application will start on `http://localhost:4200/` which will navigate you to `http://localhost:4200/products`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.*

## Routing Approach in Application

1. By default, page will be loaded on **/products** ,loading all products without any filter
2. Once any filter is applied, page url will be appended with query parameters to indicate the filter.
   
   *For eg., /products?launch_year=2008&launch_success=All&land_success=All
             /products?launch_year=2008&launch_success=true&land_success=All
             /products?launch_year=2008&launch_success=true&land_success=true*
             
3. Query parameters will be appended in the url until **any** filter is applied.
4. As and when all filters are cleared, query parameters are removed and gets redirected back to **/products**

## Server Side Rendering 

1. To facilitate web crawlers through search engine optimization(SEO)
2. To improve performance on mobile and low-powered devices
3. Show the first page quickly with a first-contentful paint

## Responsiveness in Application

1. Page has single column layout until 700 px. (Mobile device)

3. Page has three column layout from 1024 px and beyond 1440px. (Desktop device)
